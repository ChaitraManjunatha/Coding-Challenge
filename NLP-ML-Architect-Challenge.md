# Coding challenge
This page consists a challenge for Natural Langugage Processing (NLP)/Machine Learning (ML) roles at Isentia.

# Purpose
Aim of this test is three fold,

- evaluate your NLP/ML abilities 
- judge your data science experince
- understand how you select an algorithm and tune it

# How you will be judged
You will be scored on,

- overall solution design
- choice of algorithms and tools
- appropriate use of source control

# Intructions

- You can any tool or languaues you want but we suggest you use some of the following: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/), [Scipy](https://www.scipy.org/), [Spark](http://spark.apache.org/), [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/)
- Candidate should put their test results on a public code repository hosted on Github
- Once test is completed please share the Github repository URL to hiring team so they can review your work

# Challenge - Document clustering using NLP/ML techniques

## Details

# Bonus point
If you deploy the solution as a public API using an Amazon EC2 instance.
